== Env variables

To keep the production passwords from being disclosed on github the server requires a number of environment variables to be set. Eventually the dev environment set up should be automatic but for now the following variables need to be set:

* S3_BUCKET_NAME
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* SECRET_TOKEN
* PRIVATE_PUB_SECRET_TOKEN
* PRIVATE_PUB_URL (production only)
